# Open positions

It is awesome that you are interested in our research group!
Prof. Everett gets many emails from applicants but is unable to respond to them all.
Instead, the following forms will help us get to know your background and interests in a more organized way.

## Prospective Postdoctoral Researchers
Interested applicants should send an email to Prof. Everett with a CV, links to 3 representative publications, and the names/emails of 3 references.
<!-- There is not currently an open postdoc position, but this could change soon. Please fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdIS_trNtk6RdGA2UUJzWI39IKX3i6AqW5a4rtFSCeg9O13bA/viewform?usp=sf_link) to help us get to know you. -->

## Prospective PhD Students
We are hiring multiple students each application cycle. If you are interested in joining the lab as a PhD student, please help us get to know you by filling out [this form](https://forms.gle/YrK8QRT8TNao2QHV6).

Prof. Everett can advise students from either ECE or CS -- please mention his name in your application if you are interested in the lab.

## Current Northeastern MS Students
We do not currently have funding to hire MS students into the group. If you are still interested, please read [this tutorial](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.01388) on neural network verification in control, watch the corresponding [video](https://youtu.be/juiyRPUwetM), and fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdmkqZ8WlUbWYVZS4hR7iPkP7f7tCBxlH-7PQgBxySgmDUq5Q/viewform?usp=sf_link) to pitch how you will address a limitation of this research.
