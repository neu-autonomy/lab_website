          <p>We are a research group at <a href="http://neu.edu" target="_blank">Northeastern University</a>, within the <a href="https://ece.northeastern.edu/">Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering</a>, the <a href="http://khoury.northeastern.edu" target="_blank">Khoury College of Computer Sciences</a>, and the <a href="http://ier.neu.edu" target="_blank">Institute for Experiential Robotics</a>.</p>

          <p>Our research lies at the intersection of robotics, deep learning, and control theory, with the goal of developing <b>certifiable learning machines</b>.
          This means creating robots that discover how to do cool behaviors â€“ with guarantees on safety, reliability, and efficiency. Some specific techniques of interest are: reinforcement learning (RL), reachability analysis, learning cost-to-go functions, bridging semantic perception and motion planning, and model predictive control (MPC).
          A key application area of interest is navigation in challenging environments, such as off-road (e.g., forests, deserts) and alongside humans (e.g., on busy sidewalks, in crowded buildings).</p>
